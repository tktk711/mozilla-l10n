#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE:# This file must be saved as UTF8# Accesskeys are defined by prefixing the letter that is to be used for the# accesskey with an ampersand (e.g. &).# Do not replace $BrandShortName, $BrandFullName, or $BrandFullNameDA with a# custom string and always use the same one as used by the en-US files.# $BrandFullNameDA allows the string to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands# for double ampersand) and prevents the letter following the ampersand from# being used as an accesskey.# You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string# from en-US contains a \n.# Strings that require a space at the end should be enclosed with double# quotes and the double quotes will be removed. To add quotes to the beginning# and end of a strong enclose the add and additional double quote to the# beginning and end of the string (e.g. ""This will include quotes"").
