#. LOCALIZATION NOTE (safeBrowsing.label, blockWebForgeries.label, blockAttackSites.label):
#. The methods by which forged (phished) and attack sites will be detected by
#. phishing providers will vary from human review to machine-based heuristics
#. to a combination of both, so it's important that these strings convey the
#. meaning "reported" (and not something like "known").
