#. Used by screen readers to describe the Downloads Panel.
#: downloads.title

msgid "Downloads"
msgstr "Niðurtøkur"

#. Width of details for a Downloads Panel item (which directly influences the
#. width of the Downloads Panel) expressed using a CSS unit. The longest
#. labels that should fit in the item width are usually those of in-progress
#. downloads and those of blocked downloads.
#. A good rule of thumb is to try to determine the longest string possible
#. that an in-progress download could display, and use that value in ch
#. units.
#. For example, in English, a long string would be:
#. 59m 59s left - 1022 of 1023 KB (120.5 KB/sec)
#. Since Downloads Panel is redesigned to show the detail string including
#. the hovering case for an item or an action button.
#. Bug 1328519 is for discussing the detail rule of `downloadDetails.width`.
#. Do not translate this.  Only change the numeric values if you need this dialogue box to appear bigger
#: downloadDetails.width
msgid "50ch"
msgstr ""

#. Minimum width for the main description of the downloads summary,
#. which is displayed at the bottom of the Downloads Panel if the
#. number of downloads exceeds the limit that the panel can display.
#. A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads3 string
#. in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
#. maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:
#. 999 files downloading
#. that's 21 characters, so we set the minimum width to 21ch.
