#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE:
#. # Strings here are used to create events and tasks with start and end times
#. # based on email content.
#. # None of the strings are displayed in the user interface.
#. #
#. # You don't have to fill all from.*, until.*, *.prefix and *.suffix patterns.
#. # It's ok to leave some empty.
#. # Please consider declensions and gender if your language has them.
#. # Don't just translate directly. The number of variants doesn't have to be
#. # the same as in en-US. All of 0, 1, 2, etc is allowed in patterns except alphabet
#. # pattern. You can and should add language specific variants.
#. #
#. # There are two different ways to find a start time text in email:
#. # 1) it matches a from.* pattern and does not have end.prefix or end.suffix next to it
#. # 2) it matches until.* pattern and has start.prefix or start.suffix next to it
#. # Similar inverse logic applies to end times.
#. # These rules enable using prefix and suffix values with only start.* or only until.*
#. # patterns localized for some languages and thus not having to repeat the same
#. # values in both.
#. #
#. # Patterns are partially space-insensitive.
#. # "deadline is" pattern will find both "deadlineis" and "deadline  is"
#. # but "deadlineis" won't find "deadline is" or "deadline  is".
#. # Therefore you should include all spaces that are valid within a pattern.
