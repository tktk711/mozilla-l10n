#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
#. # which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
#. # The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
#. # English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
#. # You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
#. # A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
#. # documentation on web development on the web. These strings
#. # are specifically for marker names in the performance tool.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.*):
#. # These strings are displayed in the Performance Tool waterfall, identifying markers.
#. # We want to use the same wording as Google Chrome when appropriate.
