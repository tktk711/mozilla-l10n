#. "Gah" is an English slang word
#. used to express surprise or frustration (or both at the same time).  We
#. are using it to communicate in an informal way that it is both
#. frustrating that your tab crashed and a surprise that we didn't want to
#. happen. If you have a similar word or short phrase that is not profane or
#. vulgar, use it. If not, feel free to skip the word in your
#. translation.
