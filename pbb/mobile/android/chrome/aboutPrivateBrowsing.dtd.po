#. Localisation note: the plus sign here is a shorthand way of expressing the word "and". Contextually the privatebrowsingpage.title.private string
#. is used as a title, with the privatebrowsingpage.title string preceding it but on a separate line.
#. So the final line will say "Private Browsing + Tracking Protection".

msgid "+ Tracking Protection"
