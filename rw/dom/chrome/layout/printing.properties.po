#. #LOCALIZATION NOTE: Some of these messages come in pairs, one
#. # for printing and one for print previewing.  You can remove that
#. # distinction in your language by removing the entity with the _PP

#. # You can also add that distinction to any of the messages that don't
#. # already have it by adding a new entity with a _PP suffix.

#. # condition when print previewing as well as when printing.  If you
