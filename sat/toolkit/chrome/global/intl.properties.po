# Localization Note: Cases of charset names must be preserved. If you're
# adding charsets to your localized version, please refer to
# intl/uconv/src/charsetalias.properties file for the list of canonical
# charset names and use canonical names exactly as listed there.
# Also note that "UTF-8" should always be included in intl.charsetmenu.browser.static
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (general.useragent.locale):
#. # This is the valid BCP 47 language tag representing your locale.
#. #
#. # In most cases, this will simply be your locale code. However, in rare cases
#. # (such as 'jp-JP-mac'), you may need to modify your locale code in order to
#. # make it a valid BCP 47 language tag. (If your locale code does not include a
#. # region subtag, do not include one in the language tag representing your
#. # locale.)

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.accept_languages):
#. # This is a comma-separated list of valid BCP 47 language tags.
#. #
#. # Begin with the value of 'general.useragent.locale'. Next, include language
#. # tags for other languages that you expect most users of your locale to be
#. # able to speak, so that their browsing experience degrades gracefully if
#. # content is not available in their primary language.
#. #
#. # It is recommended that you include "en-US, en" at the end of the list as a
#. # last resort. However, if you know that users of your locale would prefer a
#. # different variety of English, or if they are not likely to understand
#. # English at all, you may opt to include a different English language tag, or
#. # to exclude English altogether.
#. #
#. # For example, the Breton [br] locale might consider including French and
#. # British English in their list, since those languages are commonly spoken in
#. # the same area as Breton:
#. # intl.accept_languages=br, fr-FR, fr, en-GB, en
