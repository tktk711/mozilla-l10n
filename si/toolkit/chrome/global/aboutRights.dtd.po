#. Note on pointa / pointb / pointc form:
#. These points each have an embedded link in the HTML, so each point is
#. split into chunks for text before the link, the link text, and the text
#. after the link. If a localized grammar doesn't need the before or after
#. chunk, it can be left blank.
#. Also note the leading/trailing whitespace in strings here, which is
#. deliberate for formatting around the embedded links.
