#. Used by screen readers to describe the Downloads Panel.
#: downloads.title
msgid "Downloads"
msgstr "Unduh"

#. Width of details for a Downloads Panel item (which directly influences the
#. width of the Downloads Panel) expressed using a CSS unit. The longest
#. labels that should fit in the item width are usually those of in-progress
#. downloads and those of blocked downloads.
#. A good rule of thumb is to try to determine the longest string possible
#. that an in-progress download could display, and use that value in ch
#. units.
#. For example, in English, a long string would be:
#. 59 minutes, 59 seconds remaining - 1022 of 1023 KB
#. That's 50 characters, so we set the width at 50ch.
#. Do not translate this.  Only change the numeric values if you need this dialogue box to appear bigger
#: downloadDetails.width
msgid "50ch"
msgstr ""

#. Minimum width for the main description of the downloads summary,
#. which is displayed at the bottom of the Downloads Panel if the
#. number of downloads exceeds the limit that the panel can display.
#. A good rule of thumb here is to look at the otherDownloads2 string
#. in downloads.properties, and make a reasonable estimate of its
#. maximum length. For English, this seems like a reasonable limit:
#. + 999 other downloads
#. that's 21 characters, so we set the minimum width to 21ch.
