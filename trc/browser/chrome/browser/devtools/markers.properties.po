#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Performance Tools
#. # which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu -> 'Performance'.
#. # The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
#. # English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
#. # You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
#. # A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
#. # documentation on web development on the web. These strings

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (marker.label.*):
