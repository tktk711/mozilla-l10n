#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE FOR `jsPropertyTitle` AND `jsPropertyInspectTitle`:
#. #
#. # The "PropertyPanel" is used to display a JS object to the user.
#. # If it is clear which object is being inspected (e.g., window, document object)
#. # the title of the panel is based on the `jsPropertyInspectTitle` string.
#. # If it isn't clear which object is being inspected, the `jsPropertyTitle` string
#. # gets used. This can be the case when the user logs an object to the WebConsole
#. # output using the console.log(aObjectToInspect) method.

#. # You can find a screenshot of the PropertyPanel here:
