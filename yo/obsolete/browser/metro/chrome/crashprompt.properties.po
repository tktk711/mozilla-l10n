"Firefox has a crash-reporting feature that sends a report to Mozilla when "
"Firefox crashes. Mozilla uses information in crash reports to diagnose and "
"correct problems in Firefox that cause crashes. Though this feature starts "
"automatically after Firefox crashes, it does not send information to Mozilla "
"until you explicitly authorize it to do so. By default, this feature sends a "
"variety of Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including the stack trace (a "
"detailed description of which parts of the Firefox code were active at the "
"time of the crash) and the type of computer you are using. Additional "
"information is collected by the crash reporting feature. Which crash "
"reporting feature is used and what additional information collected by "
"Firefox depends on which version of Firefox you are using."

"For current versions of Firefox, “Firefox Crash Reporter” is Firefox’s crash "
"reporting feature. With this feature, you may have the option to include "
"Personal Information (including your email address), Potentially Personal "
"Information (including your IP address and the URL of the site you were "
"visiting when Firefox crashed), and a comment. Firefox Crash Reporter also "
"sends a list of all add-ons that you were using at the time of the crash, "
"the time since (i) the last crash, (ii) the last install, and (iii) the "
"start-up of the program. Mozilla only makes Non-Personal Information (i.e., "
"generic information about your computer, the stack trace, and any comment "
"given by the user) available in the public reports available online at "
"http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/."
